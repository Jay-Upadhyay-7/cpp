Here we declared a character  variable,and then we try to give it a input which was an integer eg. 123 , and when we print
the output only 1 printed because variable is of char type  and we tried to store integer in it,char type has its own
size limitations, due to which it only stored 1,
to correct this we can take a variable of string type and then we can use function getline,which will store our input  as a string 
whether we give input integer or character.
